# Probabilistic-Models-for-FFP-Interpretation
This study quantifies uncertainties in interpreting free-fall penetrometer (FFP) data in clay and develops predictive models for static tip resistance using FFP acceleration and velocity via Bayesian inference and three probabilistic MLP methods: MaxLike, MaxLike + MCD, and Bayesian MLP-VI.
## 🧠 Methods
- Bayesian inference and MCMC for calibration of semi-empirical models  
- MaxLike, MaxLike + MCD, and Bayesian MLP-VI models  
- Evaluation of epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties  

## 🧪 Dataset
FFP and CRP paired test data collected from laboratory experiments in clay.  

## ⚙️ Requirements
```bash
pip install tensorflow tensorflow-probability numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
